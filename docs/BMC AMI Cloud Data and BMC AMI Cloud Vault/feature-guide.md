## Control-M Installation

You can install any Control-M component on a clean host or upgrade an existing installation to the latest major or fix pack version from the same installation file. There is no need to install a base version and then apply one or more fix pack. For more information, see *Control-M Upgrade*.

Modified for testing commit.

You can use the version 9.0.22 installation files to install Control-M on a clean account or upgrade an existing installation of Control-M to 9.0.22.

To ensure that the Java library remains up to date, Control-M requires an external Java installation, as described in *Control-M External Java Installation*.

The following installation pages describe how to install one or more Control-M components on a clean host:

- [Control-M Full Installation](#): Describes how to install all Control-M components on UNIX or Windows in an interactive or automatic installation. You can apply the default settings or define the database server, database name, username, hostname, and port settings.
- [Control-M/Enterprise Manager Installation](#): Describes how to install one or more instances of Control-M/Enterprise Manager (Control-M/EM).
- [Control-M/Server Installation](#): Describes how to install one or more instances of Control-M/Server.
- [Agent Installation](#): Describes how to install one or more instances of Control-M/Agent on one or more hosts in your organization. Multiple Agents enable you to enhance performance with load balancing, as described in *Host Groups*.
- [Control-M Client Installation](#): Describes how to install Control-M client on one or more hosts in your organization, which enables multiple users to simultaneously access and operate Control-M.
- [Control-M Installation on a Cloud Environment](#): Describes how to install Control-M components in a cloud environment.
- [High Availability Installation](#): Describes how to install a secondary instance of Control-M Full Installation, Control-M/EM, or Control-M/Server, which enables you to prevent downtime if a primary instance fails.
- [Control-M Cluster Configuration](#): Describes how to install Control-M in a cluster environment.

### Planning Your Installation

There are two basic installation types, as follows:

- **Full Installation**: Installs Control-M/EM and Control-M/Server on one (UNIX or Windows) account when you select the Full Install option. Full installations with dedicated PostgreSQL database servers build two databases on a single database server instance. This requires you to shut down both Control-M/EM and Control-M/Server when you backup or restore the database. For this reason, BMC recommends that you only perform full installations on test environments with limited resources.
- **Distributed Installation**: Installs Control-M/EM and Control-M/Server on separate hosts or separate (UNIX or Windows) accounts. Distributed installations enable you to backup or restore a PostgreSQL database or perform maintenance on a host or OS kernel while keeping the other host up. For this reason, BMC recommends that you use this type of installation for a production environment.

Ensure that you install the latest GA Point Patches after you install or upgrade Control-M.

### Language Options

All database-level Control-M installations support CJK (Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean), as described in *Language and Customization*. CJK settings are only automatically inherited when you create a Control-M database on an existing Oracle database server. CJK settings are not inherited on PostgreSQL or MSSQL database servers.

### Control-M Installation Terminology

The following table lists terms that are specific to Control-M.

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Control-M/EM | Provides a central point of access and control for Control-M/Servers. Control-M/Enterprise Manager (Control-M/EM) also enables you to view, monitor, manage, and intervene in batch workflow processing across the entire enterprise. (Windows only) Control-M/EM includes Control-M client. |
| Control-M Client | Provides the desktop application interface for your real-time batch environment and contains the following GUI applications: Control-M Configuration Manager (CCM), Control-M Desktop |
| Control-M/Server | Serves as the scheduling engine that schedules jobs on Agents and Agentless Hosts, manages job processing workflows, and updates Control-M/EM with job and workflow statuses. |
| Control-M/Agent | Executes jobs on behalf of the Control-M/Server that the Agent is connected to, tracks job processing, and sends job status updates to Control-M/Server. |
| Control-M Add-Ons | Enhance Control-M functionality, as described in *Control-M Advanced Features and Add-Ons*. |
| Trial Version (Full Installation) | Enables you to test Control-M/EM, Control-M/Server, and Control-M/Agent, with the following add-ons: Control-M Workload Change Manager, Control-M Workload Archiving, Control-M Workflow Insights. This version is intended for testing and evaluation, not for usage in a production environment. For production usage in the future, you must uninstall the trial version and then install a non-trial version. |
| Non-Trial Version (Full Installation) | Consists of the following Control-M components: Control-M/Enterprise Manager, Control-M/Server, Control-M/Agent |
